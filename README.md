Learning the process to create a Repository in GitHub.

Basically , here iam testing how the Branches Work in Github.
Yes, this is quite amazing as you can work on the same file which is the exact copy of the Master File
at the same time and you can create or experiment with the Master Resource and if you find the changes , i mean commits useful you can merge it to the Master Branch.
